Description: Tools for analyzing the trajectories of COVID-19 signals ---
             namely, those stored in Delphi's COVIDcast Epidata API --- and for
             building short-term forecasting models. This package is developed
             and maintained by the Delphi research group headquartered at 
             Carnegie Mellon University and is designed to be used in 
             conjunction with Delphi's `covidcast` and `evalcast` <tt>R</tt> 
             packages.
