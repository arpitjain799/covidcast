# modeltools <tt>R</tt> package

This package is developed and maintained by the 
[**Delphi research group**](https://delphi.cmu.edu/) headquartered at Carnegie
Mellon University and is designed to be used in conjunction with our
[`covidcast`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR) and 
[`evalcast`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/evalcastR) 
<tt>R</tt> packages. The `modeltools` package provides tools for analyzing the
trajectories of COVID-19 signals --- namely, those stored in Delphi's
[**COVIDcast Epidata API**](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html) ---
and for building short-term forecasting models.

**To get started** using the `modeltools` package, see the
[**Getting started guide**](../../docs/modeltoolsR/articles/modeltools.html).


## Get updates from Delphi

You should consider subscribing to Delphi's 
[**API mailing list**](https://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/delphi-covidcast-api)
to receive notifications from us. These include notifications of updates to 
Delphi's [**open-source software**](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/covidcast), 
new signals available in Delphi's API, corrections to reported data, and other 
updates. The mailing list may also be used to ask general questions.
