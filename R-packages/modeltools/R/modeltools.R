#' Tools for analyzing the trajectories of COVID signals and building
#' short-term forecasting models
#'
#' The `modeltools` package is developed and maintained by the 
#' [Delphi research group](https://delphi.cmu.edu/) headquartered at Carnegie 
#' Mellon University and is designed to be used in conjunction with Delphi's
#' [`covidcast`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR) and 
#' [`evalcast`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/evalcastR) 
#' R packages. The `modeltools` package provides tools for analyzing the 
#' trajectories of COVID-19 signals --- namely, those stored in Delphi's
#' [COVIDcast Epidata API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html)
#' --- and for building short-term forecasting models.
