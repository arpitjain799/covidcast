One of the most basic tools in the `modeltools` package is the `slide_by_geo()`
function, which is based on the family of functions provided by the 
[`slider`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/slider/vignettes/slider.html)
package. 

>**Definition:** In `modeltools`, to *slide* means that, for each `geo_value`
in a 
[`covidcast_signal`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/reference/covidcast_signal.html) 
data frame, we apply a user-specified function or formula over a trailing 
window of `n` days of data.

Many other functions in this package, such as `pct_change()` and
`estimate_deriv()`, use `slide_by_geo()` as their workhorse. Below we provide
some examples of performing sliding operations on `covidcast` signals with
`slide_by_geo()`, utilizing both the function and formula options.

We'll use the same reporting data here that we used in the
[**Getting started guide**](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/modeltoolsR/articles/modeltools.html).
The code chunk below fetches the data from the 
[**Delphi API**](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html).

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Function for displaying table heads
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
table_head <- function(x, nrows = 6, title = NULL, footnote = NULL){

  kbl.out <- x %>%
    head(nrows) %>%
    kbl(format = "html", digits = 3) %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
  
  if ( !is.null(title) ){
    header <- ncol(x)
    names(header) <- title
    kbl.out <- kbl.out %>% add_header_above(header, font_size = 15, line = F)
  }
  if ( !is.null(footnote) ){
    kbl.out <- kbl.out %>% add_footnote(footnote, notation = "symbol")
  }
  if ( nrows > 20 ){
    kbl.out <- kbl.out %>% 
      scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "300px", box_css = "border: 0px solid #fff; padding: 2px; ")
  }
  return(kbl.out)
}
```

```{r message = FALSE}
library(covidcast)
library(dplyr)

start_day <- "2020-06-01"
end_day <- "2020-11-15"
geo_values <- c("ca", "fl", "ny", "tx")

case_rates <- covidcast_signal(data_source = "usa-facts",
                               signal = "confirmed_incidence_prop",
                               start_day = start_day,
                               end_day = end_day,
                               geo_type = "state",
                               geo_values = geo_values) %>%
  select(data_source, signal, geo_value, time_value, value)
```

Here, we'll only need the 5 columns selected below. See the 
[`covidcast_signal`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/reference/covidcast_signal.html) 
documentation for a description of the full set of columns in a 
`covidcast_signal` object. The signal documentation for the USAFacts signals
specifically can be found
[here](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/usa-facts.html).


### Sliding with a formula

#### Example 1: Computing a 7-day trailing average by sliding a formula

In this example we reproduce the calculation of the smoothed daily case rates 
that is performed by the Delphi API. This can be done by passing the 
[`covidcast_signal`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/reference/covidcast_signal.html) 
data frame of raw daily case rates to `slide_by_geo()` and then passing a 7-day
trailing average formula to the `slide_fun` argument, as follows:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(modeltools)

slide_by_geo(case_rates, slide_fun = ~ Mean(.x$value), n = 7) %>%
  table_head(title = "Daily COVID-19 cases per 100,000 pop. (7-day trailing average)")
```

The `table_head()` function used above is an internal function that we use in 
these tutorial vignettes to display table heads. The source code can be found 
in the [`vignettes/modeltools.Rmd`](modeltools.Rmd) file used to build this 
page.

The formula specified by `slide_fun` has access to all columns present in the
original
[`covidcast_signal`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/reference/covidcast_signal.html) 
data frame, and must be referred to with the prefix `.x$`. Here, the function
[`modeltools::Mean()`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/reference/Min.html) 
is a simple wrapper around `mean()` that omits `NA` values by default.

Notice that the above `slide_by_geo()` call returns a data frame with a new 
column appended that contains the results of the sliding operation specified by
`slide_fun`. By default, this column is named `"slide_value"`, but alternate
names can be passed to `slide_by_geo()`, as follows:

```{r}
slide_by_geo(case_rates, slide_fun = ~ Mean(.x$value), n = 7, col_name = "7dav") %>%
  table_head(title = "Daily COVID-19 cases per 100,000 pop. (7-day trailing average)")
```

Since this example is meant to reproduce the 7-day trailing average calculation 
carried out by the Delphi API, the values in the `7dav` column should match the 
pre-computed smoothed daily case rates signal stored in the API 
(to machine precision). To check this, the code chunk below calculates the 
maximum absolute difference between the two 7-day trailing averages, 
over all state-date pairs:
$$\big\{\text{CA, FL, NY, TX}\big\} \times \big\{\text{date}: \text{date}\in \{\text{June 7, 2020, }\dots,\text{ November 15, 2020}\}\big\}.$$

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
case_rates_7dav <- covidcast_signal(data_source = "usa-facts",
                                    signal = "confirmed_7dav_incidence_prop",
                                    start_day = start_day,
                                    end_day = end_day,
                                    geo_type = "state",
                                    geo_values = geo_values) %>%
  select(data_source, signal, geo_value, time_value, value)

slide_by_geo(case_rates, slide_fun = ~ Mean(.x$value), n = 7, col_name = "7dav") %>%
  full_join(case_rates_7dav, by = c("geo_value", "time_value")) %>%
  mutate(difference = `7dav` - value.y) %>%
  filter(time_value >= "2020-06-07") %>%
  summarize(max(abs(difference))) %>%
  as.numeric
```

<details><summary>**Note:**</summary>
The raw daily case rates that we pass to `slide_by_geo()` begin on June 1, 2020,
so the `"7dav"` column created by `slide_by_geo()` doesn't represent a true 
*7-day average* until June 7, 2020. This is why we only perform the sanity check
calculation above on the dates June 7, 2020, ..., November 15, 2020. When a 
trailing window of `n` days is not available, `slide_by_geo()` just applies the
`slide_fun` function/formula to whatever data *is* available. So for June `n`th,
`n = 1,...,6`, the values in the `"7dav"` column are only `n`-day trailing
averages. Whereas the pre-computed smoothed daily case rates signal stored in
Delphi's API is a true 7-day average for all dates June 1, 2020, ..., November
15, 2020.

### Sliding with a function 

We can also pass a function to the `slide_fun` argument in `slide_by_geo()`.
In this case, the passed function must have the following input argument 
structure: 

1. `x` : a data frame with the same column names as the data frame passed to
`slide_by_geo()`

2. Any number of additional **named** arguments

3. An ellipsis `...` to allow for any number of additional general arguments

#### Example 2: Computing a 7-day trailing average by sliding a function

The code chunk below reproduces the 7-day trailing average from
[**Example 1**][Example 1: Computing a 7-day trailing average by sliding a formula], 
but passes a function to the `slide_fun` argument instead of a formula.

```{r}
slide_by_geo(case_rates, slide_fun = function(x, ...) Mean(x$value), n = 7, col_name = "7dav") %>%
  table_head(title = "Daily COVID-19 cases per 100,000 pop. (7-day trailing average)")
```
